        "designSummary": "**Neon Grid: A Fusion of Digital Brutalism and Cyberpunk Aesthetics**\n\nThe Vision: We're building a dark, immersive experience that feels both cutting-edge and approachable. The design blends the raw, structural honesty of Digital Brutalism with the vibrant, high-tech feel of Cyberpunk. The result is a website that feels like a glimpse into the future, but remains grounded in usability.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Grid as a Foundation: A modified 12-column grid provides the underlying structure, but elements are encouraged to break free and overlap.\n2. Typography with Impact: Headlines are large, bold, and impactful, acting as visual anchors. Paragraph text is clean and highly readable.\n3. The 8-Pixel Rhythm: All spacing, margins, and padding adhere to an 8px base unit for consistent visual rhythm.\n4. Neon Accents: The #0055FF accent color is used sparingly but strategically to draw attention to key elements and create a futuristic vibe.\n5. Subtle Gradients: Background gradients add depth and visual interest without overwhelming the design.",

Buttons using 'primary' with 'primaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) also meet AAA contrast requirements. The 'secondary' color (#A59FE6) on 'background' provides sufficient contrast for UI accents and secondary text, meeting WCAG AA for large text. Custom colors 'softYellowAccent' and 'lightPurpleAccent' are used in small UI elements and backgrounds where contrast requirements are less stringent but should be paired with 'primary' or 'primaryForeground' text to maintain readability and accessibility compliance."

The result is a website that feels like a glimpse into the future, but remains grounded in usability.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Grid as a Foundation: A modified 12-column grid provides the underlying structure, but elements are encouraged to break free and overlap.\n2. Typography with Impact: Headlines are large, bold, and impactful, acting as visual anchors. Paragraph text is clean and highly readable.\n3. The 8-Pixel Rhythm: All spacing, margins, and padding adhere to an 8px base unit for consistent visual rhythm.\n4. Neon Accents: The #0055FF accent color is used sparingly but strategically to draw attention to key elements and create a futuristic vibe.\n5. Subtle Gradients: Background gradients add depth and visual interest without overwhelming the design.",
